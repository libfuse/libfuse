 * to the kernel by passing the `default_permissions` mount option to
 * `fuse_session_new()`. In this case, methods will only be called if
 * the kernel's permission check has succeeded.

 * The filesystem sometimes needs to handle a return value of -ENOENT
 * from the reply function, which means, that the request was

 * fuse_reply_open() return -ENOENT means, that the release method for

	 *
	 *  - Access modes (O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR) should be used

	 *    the filesystem.
	 *
	 *  - When writeback caching is enabled, the kernel may send
	 *    read requests even for files opened with O_WRONLY. The
	 *    filesystem should be prepared to handle this.
	 *
	 *  - When writeback caching is disabled, the filesystem is
	 *    expected to properly handle the O_APPEND flag and ensure
	 *    that each write is appending to the end of the file.
	 * 
         *  - When writeback caching is enabled, the kernel will
	 *    handle O_APPEND. However, unless all changes to the file
	 *    come through the kernel this will not work reliably. The

	 *    (and let the kernel handle it), or return an error
	 *    (indicating that reliably O_APPEND is not available).
	 *
	 * Filesystem may store an arbitrary file handle (pointer,

	 * operations (read, write, flush, release, fsync).
	 *
