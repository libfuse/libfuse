 * Main function of FUSE.

 *   - parses command line options, and handles --help and
 *     --version
 *   - installs signal handlers for INT, HUP, TERM and PIPE
 *   - registers an exit handler to unmount the filesystem on program exit
 *   - creates a fuse handle
 *   - registers the operations
 *   - calls either the single-threaded or the multi-threaded event loop
 *
 * Most file systems will have to parse some file-system specific
 * arguments before calling this function. It is recommended to do
 * this with fuse_opt_parse() and a processing function that passes
 * through any unknown options (this can also be achieved by just
 * passing NULL as the processing function). That way, the remaining
 * options can be passed directly to fuse_main().
 *
 * fuse_main() accepts all options that can be passed to
 * fuse_parse_cmdline(), fuse_new(), or fuse_session_new().
 *
 * Option parsing skips argv[0], which is assumed to contain the
 * program name. This element must always be present and is used to
 * construct a basic ``usage: `` message for the --help
 * output. argv[0] may also be set to the empty string. In this case
 * the usage message is suppressed. This can be used by file systems
 * to print their own usage line first. See hello.c for an example of
 * how to do this.
 *
 * Note: this is currently implemented as a macro.
 *
 * The following error codes may be returned from fuse_main():
 *   1: Invalid option arguments
 *   2: No mount point specified
 *   3: FUSE setup failed
 *   4: Mounting failed
 *   5: Failed to daemonize (detach from session)
 *   6: Failed to set up signal handlers
