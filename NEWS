 - Out-of-tree fuse module removed

 - Better NFS exporting support

 - New ioctl and poll requests

 - New CUSE (Character Device in Userspace) interface

 - Added cache invalidation notifications

 - Bugfixes and small improvements

============================================================================

What is new in 2.7

 - Stacking support for the high level API

 - Add filename charset conversion module

 - Improved mounting

============================================================================

What is new in 2.6

 - Improved read characteristics (asynchronous reads)

 - Support for aborting filesystem connection

 - POSIX file locking support

 - Request interruption support

 - Building module for Linux kernels earlier than 2.6.9 not supported

 - Allow block device based filesystems to support swap files

 - Several bugs fixed, including a rare system hang on SMP

============================================================================

What is new in 2.5

 - Merge library part of FreeBSD port

 - New atomic create+open, access and ftruncate operations

 - On filesystems implementing the new create+open operation, and
   running on Linux kernels 2.6.15 or later, the 'cp' operation will
   work correctly when copying read-only files.

 - New option parsing interface added to the library

 - Lots of minor improvements and fixes

============================================================================

What is new in 2.4

 - Simplify device opening.  Now '/dev/fuse' is a requirement

 - Allow module auto-loading if user has access to '/dev/fuse'

 - Allow mounting over a regular file for unprivileged users

 - Allow mounting of arbitrary FUSE filesystems from /etc/fstab

 - New mount options: 'umask=M', 'uid=N', 'gid=N'

 - Check for non-empty mountpoint, and refuse mount by default.  New
   mount option: 'nonempty'

 - Low level (inode based) API added

 - Allow 'direct_io' and 'keep_cache' options to be set on a
   case-by-case basis on open.

 - Add 'attr_timeout' and 'entry_timeout' mount options to the
   high-level library.  Until now these timeouts were fixed at 1 sec.

 - Some bugfixes

============================================================================

What is new in 2.3

 - Add new directory related operations: opendir(), readdir(),
   releasedir() and fsyncdir()

 - Add init() and destroy() operations which are called before the
   event loop is started and after it has exited

 - Update kernel ABI so that on dual architectures (e.g. AMD64) 32bit
   binaries work under a 64bit kernel

 - Bugfixes

============================================================================

What is new in 2.2

Userspace changes:

 - Add fuse_file_info structure to file operations, this allows the
   filesystem to return a file handle in open() which is passed to
   read(), write(), flush(), fsync() and release().

 - Add source compatibility with 2.1 and 1.4 releases

 - Binary compatibility with 2.1 release is retained

Kernel changes:

 - Make requests interruptible.  This prevents the filesystem to go
   into an unbreakable deadlock with itself.

 - Make readpages() synchronous.  Asynchronous requests are deadlock
   prone, since they cannot be interrupted (see above)

 - Remove shared-writeable mapping support, which could deadlock the
   machine

 - Remove INVALIDATE userspace initiated request

 - Update ABI to be independent of sizeof(long), so dual-size archs
   don't cause problems

 - Remove /sys/fs/fuse/version.  Version checking is now done through
   the fuse device

 - Replace directory reading method on the kernel interface.  Instead
   of passing an open file descriptor to the kernel, send data through
   the FUSE device, like all other operations.
