# The following strings shouldn't actually be accepted, but they're wrongly
# identified as words and there is currently no way to exclude them on
# a by-line basis (https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell/pull/2400).
# Therefore, pretend that they are correctly spelled words:
# - alse: used in regex
# - siz:  wanted short
# - fiter:  variable
ignore-words-list = alse,siz,fiter
